# Readme

## Description
Hello! This is my readme generator bot. Its purpose is to generate a readme file based upon the information collected
via a series of prompts from the user. It then takes this data and generates a readme file based around the input and
options selected. It is very simple to use, it merely requires that the user run the index.js file in order to intialize
the prompts and then answer said questions. It uses a series of functions and variables in order to do so, rendering a final product
that is ready for use.
